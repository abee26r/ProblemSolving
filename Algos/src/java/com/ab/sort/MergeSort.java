 * Merge sort: When you need a stable, O(N log N) sort, this is about your only
 * option. The only downsides to it are that it uses O(N) auxiliary space and
 * has a slightly larger constant than a quick sort. There are some in-place
 * merge sorts, but AFAIK they are all either not stable or worse than O(N log
 * N). Even the O(N log N) in place sorts have so much larger a constant than
 * the plain old merge sort that they're more theoretical curiosities than
 * useful algorithms.
